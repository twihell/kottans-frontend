Hi there!

My name is Rita. I really appreciate all the work you do. 
Your study materials were truly handy, although it takes so much time
to get through all the links you share at once, especially when you're completely
new to the indstry. It took me a month to get into Git and github :c But I hope to
speed up and do the whole phase 0 as fast as I can - even if I won't get to take part
in the actual course.

## Linux CLI, and HTTP

The Command Line course on Codecademy tought me a bunch of useful commands
that will help me effectively navigate through my file system and edit it,
which is nice! The key elements that I found especially useful are
the command redirection features like pipes (|). Thanks to pipes, for instance,
I can redirect the output of a previous command and treat it as the input
of a following command - all via one command line! In addition, I learnt how to
set up my work environment but also how to simplify my work through creating
command shortcuts. This is primarily useful if I want to save my time
and energy on doing repetitive things. However, bash scripting was by far
the most challenging and interesting part of the whole course. As far as I 
understood, I will be using scripting for various frontend tasks in the future,
so I intened to learn more about algorithms and scripting to become more efficient
in coding. 
The article on the HTTP protocol was quite detailed and challenging too. However,
I managed to finally get into the essence of the request/response communication 
between the client and the server. The article was more about theory than practice
though, which is why I had to force myself to read further. Nevertheles, I understand
that this is a very important material which prepares me for the web development challenges
that await me in the future.

Thank you for sharing these precious materials with us!
