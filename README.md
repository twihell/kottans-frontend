Hi there!

My name is Rita. I really appreciate all the work you do. 
Your study materials were truly handy, although it takes so much time
to get through all the links you share at once, especially when you're completely
new to the indstry. It took me a month to get into Git and github :c But I hope to
speed up and do the whole phase 0 as fast as I can - even if I won't get to take part
in the actual course.
